 The following keywords are reserved and can’t be used as identifiers, unless they’re escaped with backticks, as described above in Identifiers. Keywords other than inout, var, and let can be used as parameter names in a function declaration or function call without being escaped with backticks. When a member has the same name as a keyword, references to that member don’t need to be escaped with backticks, except when there’s ambiguity between referring to the member and using the keyword—for example, self, Type, and Protocol have special meaning in an explicit member expression, so they must be escaped with backticks in that context.

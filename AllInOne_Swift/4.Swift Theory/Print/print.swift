// *** Function ***

// print(_:separator:terminator:)

// Writes the textual representations of the given items into the standard output.


// *** Declaration ***

//func print(_ items: Any..., separator: String = default, terminator: String = default)

 
// *** Parameters ***
 
 - items
 Zero or more items to print.
 
 - separator
 A string to print between each item. The default is a single space (" ").
 
 - terminator
 The string to print after all items have been printed. The default is a newline ("\n").
 
// *** Discussion ***
 
 You can pass zero or more items to the print(_:separator:terminator:) function. The textual representation for each item is the same as that obtained by calling String(item). The following example prints a string, a closed range of integers, and a group of floating-point values to standard output:
 
 print("One two three four five")
 // Prints "One two three four five"
 
 
 print(1...5)
 // Prints "1...5"
 
 
 print(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)
 // Prints "1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0"
 
 
 To print the items separated by something other than a space, pass a string as separator.
 
 
 print(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, separator: " ... ")
 // Prints "1.0 ... 2.0 ... 3.0 ... 4.0 ... 5.0"
 
 
 The output from each call to print(_:separator:terminator:) includes a newline by default. To print the items without a trailing newline, pass an empty string as terminator.
 
 
 
 for n in 1...5 {
 
 print(n, terminator: "")  // "" for print in same line or remove next line
 
 }
 
 // Prints "12345"

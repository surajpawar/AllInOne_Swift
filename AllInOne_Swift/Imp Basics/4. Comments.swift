 ******  Comments *******
 
 Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.
 
 Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):
 
 // This is a comment.
 Multiline comments start with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/):
 
 /* This is also a comment
 but is written over multiple lines. */
 Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be nested inside other multiline comments. You write nested comments by starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline comment within the first block. The second block is then closed, followed by the first block:
 
 /* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
 /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
 This is the end of the first multiline comment. */

 Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline comments.
